Set your bot's token in the conf/config.py TOKEN = 'TOKEN' file. You can get a token by creating your bot at @BotFather.

Set the address of your channel in the file conf/config.py CHANNEL_ID =
'@CHANNEL_ID'.

You can make any user an administrator of the bot by taking his ID from a file data/users_id.txt and by placing it in the list of admins in the file conf/config.py ADMIN_ID = [752762150, ] add it separated by commas.

Or you can always write to me @halo_bi. (Consultations or editing of the bot can be paid, any actions to support the bot are paid separately)
